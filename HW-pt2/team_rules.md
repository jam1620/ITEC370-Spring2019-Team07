# Team 07 Rules

These rules establish how our team will assign tasks,
track progress on each task, and communicate with each other 
when a member is unable to complete a task that has been assigned to that member.

This document helps individual members understand the team's expectations,
and will hopefully lead to productive team work with fewer conflicts
and missed deadlines.

## How we will assign (and reassign) tasks
We will assign task based on who is the most experinced in said task.


## How will we will track progress (and follow-up) on completion of tasks
In our weekly team meetings we will see how everyone is doing on their respective tasks.


## How will communicate difficulties with a task assigned to us
We will be able to communicate through text and video calls and be able to work together on difficult tasks.


## How we will back up each other to ensure that deadlines are not missed
if a team member needs help then they can ask for help or wait until our weekly team meetings to ask for more help
to ensure they get their task done before the deadlines.
